## Problem: Hiring Experienced Cyber Security Analysts

The cybersecurity industry faces a persistent talent gap despite growing demand. According to Lightcast.io, the U.S. had over 1.5 million cybersecurity job openings in 2024, with only about 1.28 million workers available, leaving a gap of approximately 225,200 professionals. The demand spans multiple industries, with mid-level roles requiring 2-10 years of experience facing the highest shortages.
